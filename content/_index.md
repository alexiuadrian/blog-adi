Hi stranger,  

Welcome to my website and blog. My name is Adrian Alexiu, I live in Romania and I often switch from Ploiesti to Bucharest. My goal is to switch between more cities ;) 

I am currently working as a Backend Engineer for Matrix Software House with Ruby on Rails. I also do some frontend work with React and deploy our web applications on Linux servers.

I am also a student at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science in Bucharest, where I am studying Security and Applied Logic Master's Program.

## Meet me

If you want to talk to me about business, you can book a meeting [HERE](https://calendly.com/adialexiu/30min).

## My interests

I am a passionate individual who loves to learn new things and to share my knowledge with others.  
But I do like some things more than others, and here are some of them:
* Entrepreneurship (I am in love with this topic and I just can't get enough of it)
* Programming (I love to code and I am always looking for new challenges)
* Football (I love watching, playing and talking about football - I could do it all day long)
* Technology (I love to learn about new technologies and how they work)

## My projects

I have a few projects that I am working on and that I have worked on, and I am always looking for new ideas. You can find all of them on my [GitHub](https://github.com/alexiuadrian) profile.  

I don't think I have a favorite project because I put effort in everything I do. There is one project that I really fell in love with and that I am working on right now, and that is [this one](https://vreaupodcast.ro). It is a landing page for a podcast production company that I am on the verge of starting.

## About this website

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. I chose Hugo because it is fast, easy to use, and has a lot of themes to choose from. I am a huge advocate of learning new languages and Go is one that I have been looking to learn for a while now.  

The website doesn't do much (and I intend to keep it that way), but I am planning on adding a few things in the future.
