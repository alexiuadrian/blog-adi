I have heard review after review and seen video after video about how bad and how good the "new" Cyberpunk 2077 video game is.  

I preordered it for a friend of mine as a gift for their birthday a couple of months before the much expected release. I can't say I didn't want it for myself after finding out how long was the game in development for.

Time passed and the game got released. He and another friend of mine started playing it and I watched their streams on Discord, helping to take decision. Fun times.

Then, the reviews poured in a ton of hate. And why? Because the launch didn't contain everything that was promised. Isn't that is how those things work?  

Yeah, those are unfair. However, people were most upset about the bugs and glitches. I mean, it's a game, it's supposed to have bugs and glitches but this is a little too much.  

And this problem was on PC, the platform where things were *OK*. But let's talk about the consoles. Funny talk.  

So, the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game were a complete mess. And I mean an unplayable mess. Game-breaking bugs, glitches, crashes, you name it. The visuals, absolutely terrible. It was so unplayable that CDPR had to pull the game from the stores and when it was back, the description was changed to "not recommended for PS4 and Xbox One". 

YES, A VIDEO GAME COMPANY HAD TO CHANGE THE DESCRIPTION OF THEIR GAME TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THE PLATFORMS THAT IT WAS MADE FOR.

hahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahahaahhahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaahaha

Of course, they released updates that improved the situation slightly but to this day it is not a good experience.

Anyway, next gen consoles came out and the game was released for them. And it was a completely different story. The game was amazing. The visuals were amazing. The bugs were gone. The glitches were gone. The crashes were gone. The game was amazing. Everybody loved it. 

Morale of the story: 
### *The consoles are dead. Long live the consoles.*  

I couldn't care less about what was happening to the game as I owned a PS4 at that time and my PC couldn't really handle it. 

Fast forward two beautiful years. I now own an Xbox Series S and I recently bought the game to see what is all this about. I wanted to do this for quite some time because I have become a fan of the synthwave-80s-retro-futuristic-cyberpunk-inspired-aesthetic that the game and its soundtrack have.

I didn't know the story of the game, I didn't know the characters, I didn't know the setting. I didn't know anything about it. I just knew that it was a game that I wanted to play. I wanted to play it because I wanted to experience the world that CD Projekt Red created. I wanted to experience the story that they told. I wanted to experience the characters that they created. I wanted to experience the game that they made.

I am crazy about it. Sold 100%. I don't care about the bad reviews or any controversy. I am inside the story, inside the Cyberpunk 2077 world. Crazy to think it would come to this but I KNEW I should have bought it. Also, payed $10 for it so it was a steal.

I spent this last weekend playing for like 20-ish hours and can't get enough. No fucking way I will finish the game soon, it's so big. I am just taking my time and enjoying the ride. I am not in a hurry. I am not in a rush. I am just enjoying the smooth ride through Night City.  

Well that was my take on Cyberpunk 2077. If you haven't played it I sincerely recommend it.  

I am probably going to write some more about it and before I finish it I think it will have become my favorite game of all time.
