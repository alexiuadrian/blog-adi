> How cloud storage is becoming more and more popular

Thanks to the very fast paced development in technology, more and more people are starting to adopt the new methods as standard. When we talk about businesses, we have seen an enormous switch from on-premise storage using expensive equipment, which was anyway filled half-way all the time, to cloud storage.

This happened mainly because businesses are very keen on making profit and not losing money, and they also have a lot of data on their hands.

According to an article entitled "Number of Photos (2022): Statistics, Facts, & Predictions" [[1]](#\_gllh911m7sbi), 1,72 trillion photos are taken every year which **roughly** translates to 215 photos taken by a person. A photo taken with my phone (iPhone X) averages at around 1.5 MB, we can safely assume that one person will gather at least 400 - 500 MB in a year. Of course, these numbers are merely a representation of the amount of data a person generates in a year. Maybe a more realistic number would be in the range of 10 to 20 GB.

The files being stored by people are mainly photos, videos (which increase greatly in size compared to photos), documents such as personal files, books and so on.

Numbers are interesting but enough with data generation. After this step, there is a big question to be asked: **"Where do we store this data?"**

There are many ways in which data can be persisted, but there are a few which actually make sense.

One of the most used devices for storing data among people are usb drives. They are cheap ($20 will get you up to 128 GB), relatively fast and small enough to double up as a keychain. Almost everybody has such a device in their house somewhere and they are still widely used for many activities.

However, they have many disadvantages too. Being a physical storage device it can either break (humidity, physical damage, short circuit, software errors) or get lost, both cases would cause the data to be lost forever.

Since the invention and commercial availability of cloud computing, another disadvantage would be the lack of being able to share the content of the storage device with someone not in your proximity.

Cloud storage is now at the tips of your fingers. There is no need to go to the local electronics shop to buy a new usb drive when you can simply enter Google Drive and buy one year's worth of storage by simply filling up your credit card data.

When we talk about cloud storage we refer to all the commercial solutions in the market, not just one. They all do the same thing at the end of the day, regardless of pros and cons: **They deliver a safe space on the cloud for the user to upload their files.**

To begin with, cloud storage offers you availability for your data 24/7 in the same exact location. Your information is locked behind many firewalls, IDS, IPS and encryption algorithms and can be unlocked only by you and the ones you give access to. Sharing your data just requires an email and a link and someone in the opposite part of the world is able to access it.

The main disadvantage of cloud storage is its price. It usually comes as a monthly or yearly subscription and with different plans. Taking Google One as an example, $30 per year will get you 200 GB of space [[3]](#\_gllh911m7sbi). Compared to traditional physical storage devices, the main disadvantage is that you will have to pay for this storage as long as you want it instead of a one time payment.

Of course, free plans are available to almost all major providers, but the space is limited (and in some cases merged with email storage - Google Drive).

Pricing could be a downside for some people, but at the end of the day, you are not paying for the storage, you are paying for all the security and availability measures taken to store your data.

While some people keep sticking to their old ways of doing things and not trusting non-tangible storage devices, many others came to the conclusion that high availability and convenient access to their data is very important to them and chose to migrate their digital belongings to the cloud.

Following the trends, it has been forecasted that the cloud storage market value will grow from $83 billion in 2022 to $376 billion in 2029 [[4]](#\_gllh911m7sbi), so the future of development points up to the clouds for us to send our information.
