Hello, World!

This is my first post on this blog. I hope you like it!

I want to start by saying that this website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. I chose Hugo because it is fast, easy to use, and has a lot of themes to choose from. I also chose Hugo because it is written in Go, which is a language I am learning. 

There is not much to say about this post, so I will end it here. I hope you enjoyed reading this post, and I hope you will enjoy reading my future posts.
